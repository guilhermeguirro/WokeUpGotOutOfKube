# Integrating Your Architecture Diagram into Medium

## Creating Your Diagram

1. **Choose your tool** - Based on previous recommendations, either:
   - [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) (professional, feature-rich)
   - [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) (free, powerful)

2. **Create the diagram** following your detailed specification in `platform-architecture-diagram.md`

3. **Apply consistent styling**:
   - Use the blue/teal financial services color palette
   - Maintain consistent icon styles throughout
   - Apply proper layering from infrastructure (bottom) to compliance (top)

## Exporting & Preparing Your Diagram

1. **Export as high-quality PNG**:
   - Resolution: At least 1600px width (2000px recommended for Medium)
   - Aspect ratio: 16:9 or 4:3 works best for Medium articles
   - File format: PNG with transparent background

2. **Review the exported image**:
   - Check text readability at various zoom levels
   - Ensure colors appear as intended
   - Verify all components are visible and properly labeled

## Uploading Your Diagram

### Option 1: Using Imgur (Recommended)

1. Go to [Imgur.com](https://imgur.com/) and sign in (or create a free account)
2. Click the "New Post" button in the top left
3. Upload your diagram PNG
4. Once uploaded, right-click on the image and select "Copy image address" or "Copy image link"
5. This gives you a direct link like `https://i.imgur.com/ABCDEFG.png`

### Option 2: Using Medium's Native Image Upload

1. This option works when you're actively editing your article
2. We'll cover this in the embedding section below

## Embedding in Your Medium Article

### Method 1: Replace the Existing Placeholder Image

Since you already have a placeholder in your article:

```markdown
![Platform Architecture Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/nhQR5LD.png)
*High-level architecture of our financial services Kubernetes platform*
```

1. Edit your Medium article
2. Find this image reference
3. Replace the URL `https://i.imgur.com/nhQR5LD.png` with your new image URL
4. Keep the caption text as is

### Method 2: Using Medium's Editor

1. Open your Medium article in edit mode
2. Position your cursor where you want the diagram to appear
3. Press Enter to create a new line if needed
4. Click the "+" button that appears on the left
5. Select the "Image" option
6. Either:
   - Paste the Imgur URL you copied earlier, or
   - Click "Upload" and select your diagram file from your computer
7. Once the image appears, click it to select it
8. Click the "Caption" option that appears below
9. Enter the caption: "High-level architecture of our financial services Kubernetes platform"

## Optimizing Image Display in Medium

1. **Full-width display**: In the Medium editor, when your image is selected, click the "Full-width" option that appears below the image

2. **Image spacing**: Add a blank line before and after your image for proper spacing

3. **Caption formatting**: Medium automatically styles captions in italics and smaller text, which is perfect for technical diagrams

## Checking Your Work

Before publishing:

1. Preview your article to ensure the diagram appears correctly
2. Check how it looks on both desktop and mobile views
3. Verify that the image loads quickly (if it's slow, you may need to optimize the file size)
4. Ensure the caption is proper and readable

## Making Later Updates

If you need to update your diagram later:

1. Make changes in your original diagramming tool
2. Export a new PNG with the same dimensions
3. If using Imgur, you can replace the image keeping the same URL:
   - Sign in to Imgur
   - Go to "Posts" or "Images"
   - Find and select your diagram
   - Click "Edit"
   - Delete the old image and upload the new one with the same name
4. If using Medium direct upload, you'll need to delete the old image and insert the new one

## Final Tips

- **Alt text**: While not directly editable in Medium, your caption functions as alternative text for accessibility
- **Consistency**: Ensure your diagram's style matches other visuals in your article
- **White space**: Give the diagram room to breathe with proper spacing
- **References**: Consider adding numbered references in your diagram that correspond to sections in your article

With these steps, your detailed DevSecOps architecture diagram will be properly integrated into your Medium article, enhancing the visual appeal and technical clarity of your content.
