# Platform Architecture Diagram Specification

## Diagram Title
"A Day in the Kube: DevSecOps Platform Architecture for Financial Applications"

## Purpose
This diagram will illustrate the comprehensive DevSecOps platform architecture described in the Medium article, highlighting the security controls, multi-cloud deployment, and key components that make up the "A Day in the Kube" platform.

## Design Style
- Clean, professional with a blue/teal color scheme (financial services)
- Clearly labeled components with security elements highlighted
- Layer-based approach showing the flow from developer to production
- Use of recognizable icons for Kubernetes, cloud providers, and security tools

## Architecture Components to Include

### 1. Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Layer (Bottom)
- AWS EKS, Azure AKS, and GCP GKE clusters represented side by side
- Show dedicated node pools for application vs. security workloads
- Include WAF components at the edge (AWS WAF, Azure Application Gateway, GCP Cloud Armor)
- Private networking with clearly marked ingress/egress paths

### 2. Kubernetes Security Layer
- Kyverno policies (visualized as a shield or filter around the clusters)
- Network policies (visualized as walls or boundaries between components)
- Istio service mesh (visualized as a connected mesh across services)
- Container security (scanning and verification)

### 3. Secret Management Layer
- HashiCorp Vault (central component)
- Dynamic secrets workflow
- Automatic rotation visualization
- Integration with cloud IAM systems

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline (Left Side)
- Developer commits code to source repository
- Security scanning phases:
  - SonarCloud (Static analysis)
  - Snyk (Dependency scanning)
  - Checkov (IaC scanning)
  - Gitleaks (Secret detection)
- ArgoCD GitOps deployment with verification step

### 5. Monitoring and Response Layer (Right Side)
- Falco runtime security monitoring
- Observability stack:
  - Prometheus
  - Loki
  - Tempo
  - Grafana dashboards showing security metrics

### 6. Compliance Layer (Top)
- Automated compliance reporting
- Policy enforcement visualization
- Audit trail collection

## Flow Direction
- The diagram should show the flow from developer input (bottom left) through the security controls and ultimately to production deployment (top right)
- Security controls should be visibly integrated at each stage of the workflow

## Key Visual Elements
- Shield icons to represent security controls
- Lock icons for secret management
- Warning/alert icons for security monitoring
- Document/check icons for compliance
- Kubernetes logo at the center of the architecture

## Text Elements to Include
- Brief labels for each component
- Caption: "High-level architecture of our financial services Kubernetes platform"
- Small legend explaining key security control types

## Notes
- The diagram should emphasize the "security as code" concept with visual cues
- Multi-cloud deployment should be clear but not overwhelm the security aspects
- The diagram should be readable when embedded at medium size in the article
