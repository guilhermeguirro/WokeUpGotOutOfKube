## Implementation Process

1. **Start with infrastructure layer:** Begin by placing your multi-cloud infrastructure components at the bottom
2. **Add security components layer by layer:** Work upward through your security stack
3. **Create clear visual separation** between layers using colors or borders
4. **Use consistent icon styles** throughout (don't mix different icon sets)
5. **Add directional arrows** showing the flow of deployment, data, and security controls
6. **Include a small legend** explaining your security control indicators
7. **Test readability at medium size** (how it will appear in your article)
8. **Use color strategically** to highlight security elements (shields, policies, etc.)

## Icon Resources

- **Kubernetes Icons:** [Official Kubernetes Icons](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/icons)

## Exporting for Medium

For Medium articles, export your diagram as:
1. PNG with at least 1600px width for good resolution
2. Upload to an image hosting service like Imgur
3. Medium-friendly aspect ratio of approximately 16:9 or 4:3
4. Include your caption text directly in the Medium article, not embedded in the image

## Alternative: Professional Design Services
