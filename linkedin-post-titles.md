**Title:** "Building the Financial Fortress: How We Engineered a Zero-Compromise DevSecOps Platform for Regulated Environments"

**Supporting text:**
Excited to share my latest article detailing our journey building a comprehensive DevSecOps platform for financial applications. We've created a multi-cloud Kubernetes infrastructure that embeds security throughout the development lifecycle while maintaining compliance and developer velocity.

Key topics include:
• Policy-driven security with Kyverno
• Multi-cloud implementation across AWS, Azure, and GCP
• Secrets management with HashiCorp Vault
• Automated compliance controls for financial regulations
• Zero-trust network architecture with Istio

Whether you're in fintech, working with regulated workloads, or interested in advanced Kubernetes security patterns, I'd love your thoughts!
