**Title:**
A Day in the Kube: Building a Comprehensive DevSecOps Platform for Financial Applications

**Career-focused post text:**
Excited to share my latest article showcasing my experience designing and implementing a secure, compliant Kubernetes platform for financial applications!

In "A Day in the Kube," I demonstrate how I architected a multi-cloud DevSecOps infrastructure that embeds security throughout the development lifecycle while maintaining compliance and developer velocity.

My expertise highlighted in this project includes:
• Designing security-hardened Kubernetes clusters across AWS, Azure, and GCP
• Implementing policy enforcement with Kyverno for automated guardrails
• Configuring zero-trust network architecture with Istio service mesh
• Establishing dynamic secrets management with HashiCorp Vault
• Deploying GitOps workflows with ArgoCD
• Implementing runtime security with Falco

I'm always open to discussing new opportunities where I can apply these skills to solve complex security and infrastructure challenges.
